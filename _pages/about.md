I enjoy working at the interface of computational biology and machine learning to better understand biology and enhance human health. I have experience in developing deep learning models for the analysis of biomedical data from various modalities, including blood cytometry, electrocardiogram recordings, and medical notes.

To gain insights into biological mechanisms, I have conducted genetic association studies using innovative phenotypes like cellular perturbation responses and deep learning-derived cardiac traits in biobank-scale cohorts as well as integrative analyses of sequencing, metabolomic, and proteomic data across human and animal models.

My current research focuses on pediatric genetic conditions, combining curated phenotypes with those extracted from medical notes to identify novel gene-phenotype associations. I'm also developing natural language-based systems that will allow clinicians and researchers to explore this population using flexible phenotypic and genetic queries. This work aims to bridge the gap between complex genomic data and clinical applications, improving diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric genetic disorders.

I'm a senior data scientist at [Nationwide Children's Hospital](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org). I did a postdoc at the [MacRae Lab](https://macraelab.bwh.harvard.edu) and [One Brave Idea](https://www.onebraveidea.org), and obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the [Troyanskaya Lab](https://function.princeton.edu).
