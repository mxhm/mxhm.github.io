I enjoy working at the interface of computational biology and machine learning to better understand biology and enhance human health. I have experience in developing deep learning models for the analysis of biomedical data from various modalities, including blood cytometry, electrocardiogram recordings, and medical notes.

To gain insights into biological mechanisms, I have conducted genetic association studies using innovative phenotypes like cellular perturbation responses and deep learning-derived cardiac traits in biobank-scale cohorts as well as integrative analyses of sequencing, metabolomic, and proteomic data across human and animal models.

I am currently a principal data scientist at [Mass General Brigham](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org). I did my postdoc at the [MacRae Lab](https://macraelab.bwh.harvard.edu) and [One Brave Idea](https://www.onebraveidea.org), and obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the [Troyanskaya Lab](https://function.princeton.edu). At [Nationwide Children's Hospital](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org), I worked on pediatric genetic conditions, combining curated phenotypes with those extracted from medical notes to identify novel gene-phenotype associations.
